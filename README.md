## Recipe Filter Chrome Extension

This Chrome plugin helps cut through to the chase when browsing food blogs. It is born out of my frustration in having to scroll through a prolix life story before getting to the recipe card that I really want to check out.

It works by identifying recipes in websites that conform to some common patterns. It brings a copy of the recipe card front-and-center and includes a button to dismiss it so you can see the full site. It works in concert with bookmarklets that can save to your favorite recipe manager (i.e. Paprika).



### Installing

Once out of beta testing, you will be able to install from the [Google Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions).

The fastest way to try it out is to directly install the latest CRX from Github [by clicking here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sean-public/RecipeFilter/master/RecipeFilter.crx).
